## 1. Introduction

Hybrid prediction through genomic selection (GS) is a tool that can reduce time and costs related with the generation of successful hybrids. The development of GS prediction models is expected to increase the probability of superior hybrids reaching advanced field-testing stages. In this study we explore the potential of implementing GS in a sweet corn breeding program through hybrid prediction in an across-year framework and we validate the implementation of genomic selection in a long-term in the sweet corn breeding program by stochastic simulations.

## 2. Material and Methods

A total of 513 hybrids were created from a collaboration between the University of Florida and University of Wisconsin sweet corn breeding programs. Hybrids were assessed in three locations - Florida (FL), California (CA), and Wisconsin (WI) - in two consecutive years (2020-21). We compare the ability of two GS models (genomic best linear unbiased prediction -GBLUP- and reproducing kernel Hilbert space -RKHS) in single- and multi-trait framework (STM and MTM) for hybrid prediction. The models used accounted for additive (A) and additive + dominance (AD) effects. The traits assessed were as followed:

Trait architectures where also used to perform a multi-trait breeding simulation for six traits that mimic important sweet corn fresh market traits. We evaluated the long-term effectiveness of GS implementation (30 years of simulation). 

## 3. Results

The RKHS models outperformed GBLUP models in across-year prediction (18%, 16%, 16% for CA, FL, and WI sites, respectively). The use of models accounting for AD effects increased the predictability in 15% (CA), 9% (FL), and 15% (WI) compared with the models with only A effects. Overall, the MTM outperformed STM by 11%, 15%, and 14%, for CA, FL, and WI, respectively. Simulations indicated that hybrid performance differed depending on the target trait considered. Generally, some traits presented large hybrid gains over time while other traits presented only small hybrid gains. 


## 4. Conclusion

This study showed the potential of improving hybrid prediction in a sweet corn breeding program by considering RKHS, multitrait and, AD effects in a model.
